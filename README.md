# paper-api-client

This module is all about hiding the ugly details of whatever REST API
your NodeJS app is integrating with

You specify the host, the protocol and a set of end points and you get an object that
can provide URLs for your endpoints. You can also write methods to hide the actual request details.

You can see examples [here](https://github.com/tybenz/paper-api-client/tree/master/examples).
